# 13-EatDaBurger
An exercise in creating ORMs and using Handlebars!

This app allows you to enter the name a hamburger you would like to eat, and then submit it.  The name appears on the left with a button for you to choose when to 'DEVOUR' that burger.  Once you click to 'DEVOUR', the burger is added to the right in a list of devoured burgers.  Clearly, there is no real world value in using Eat-Da-Burger itself, but the core concepts and coding techniques have infinite applications.
